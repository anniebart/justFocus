#Just Focus

###This is a simple web app to test your own ability to hold focus on something as simple as breathing. 

**How does it work?**
A user will enter in the amount of time they wish to focus or meditate for and then the timer begins its countdown. If the user moves the mouse, the timer will reset and then begin the countdown again. 

Can you make it all the way without resetting? How long can you maintain focus?



**Why should we bother with focusing on breathing?**

Focusing on the breath is helpful to ground oneself and reduce anxiety. A lot of meditation practices use breathwork as a core component. 

If you find yourself drifting away or losing focus, that's totally okay and normal. But rather than moving on to do something else, try mentally noting something like 'thinking' and return your attention to your breathing.

With regular practice, I've noticed a lot less stress and feel a greater ability to focus on tasks for longer periods of time without distraction :)
